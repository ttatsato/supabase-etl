/// Trait for systems that can receive replicated data from ETL pipelines.
///
/// [`Destination`] implementations define how replicated data is written to
/// target systems. The trait supports both bulk operations for initial table
/// synchronization and streaming operations for real-time replication events.
///
/// The interface is intentionally small and generic. ETL provides ordered data
/// plus minimal coordination hooks, and each destination is free to choose its
/// own execution model, such as inline writes, actors, queues, or spawned
/// tasks.
///
/// ETL is at-least-once, so destinations must tolerate duplicate writes. ETL
/// may also call destination methods in parallel under some circumstances, so
/// implementations must be safe for concurrent use.
pub trait Destination {
    /// Returns the name of the destination.
    fn name() -> &'static str;

    /// Propagates the shutdown signal to the destination.
    ///
    /// Override this method if the destination needs cleanup or bookkeeping
    /// during shutdown. Background streaming destinations should use it to
    /// stop writer loops and drain or drop outstanding work. ETL calls this
    /// method at most once for a destination instance, after it has stopped
    /// submitting new work. The default implementation is a no-op.

    /// Drops destination objects before restarting a table copy.
    ///
    /// This operation is called when table synchronization intentionally
    /// restarts from scratch. Implementations should remove the destination
    /// object and any destination-private replay markers for the table so the
    /// next copy can recreate it from the fresh source schema.
    ///
    /// The supplied schema describes the previously known destination table and
    /// exists only so the destination can locate what should be removed. ETL
    /// clears its own destination metadata and stored schemas only after this
    /// result completes successfully.

    /// Writes a batch of table rows to the destination.
    ///
    /// This method is used during initial table synchronization to bulk load
    /// existing data. Rows are provided as [`TableRow`] instances with
    /// typed cell values. ETL may call this method multiple times with
    /// different batches, including in parallel with other destination
    /// work.
    ///
    /// This method is called even if the source table has no data, so the
    /// destination can prepare its initial state before streaming begins.
    /// ETL does not impose a meaningful ordering requirement on these row
    /// batches; it just provides the data that should be written for the
    /// initial snapshot.

    /// The method return value is reserved for immediate dispatch/setup
    /// failures before the work has been accepted.
    ///
    /// ETL still waits for each table-copy batch to finish before reading the
    /// next batch for the same copy partition. For non-parallel table copy,
    /// that means a new batch is requested only after the previous result
    /// completes. For parallel table copy, ETL already invokes this
    /// method concurrently across partitions, so the asynchronous result is
    /// mostly an API consistency tool rather than a way to queue all copy
    /// batches and wait at the end.

    /// This immediate waiting is intentional: it preserves backpressure and
    /// avoids accumulating too many in-flight row batches in memory.

    /// This method handles real-time changes from the Postgres replication
    /// stream. Events include inserts, updates, deletes, and transaction
    /// boundaries. ETL may call this method multiple times with different
    /// streaming batches.
    ///
    /// The main ordering guarantee is per table: ETL preserves the required
    /// order for streaming operations on the same table.
    ///
    /// Implementations report asynchronous completion through `async_result`.
    /// The method return value is reserved for immediate dispatch/setup
    /// failures before the work has been accepted.
    ///
    /// This lets ETL distinguish synchronous dispatch errors from asynchronous
    /// flush completion. This is also the path where ETL gains real
    /// overlap: once dispatch succeeds, the apply loop may continue
    /// processing while the destination finishes the current batch. ETL still
    /// will not hand the destination the next streaming batch until the
    /// previous `async_result` has been completed.
    ///
    /// Async implementations that offload work should coordinate `async_result`
    /// with [`Destination::shutdown`]. ETL calls [`Destination::shutdown`]
    /// at most once and only after it has stopped submitting new work. If
    /// the apply loop has already gone away, sending the result will fail
    /// and may be treated as an implicit cancellation.
    ///
    /// During the initial copy phase, transaction boundaries are not a stable
    /// global invariant across all tables. A source transaction may be
    /// split across multiple streaming deliveries as some tables are
    /// already ready for streaming and others are still being copied. In
    /// practice, destinations should rely on per-table event ordering and
    /// not assume that `begin`/`commit` boundaries always describe a
    /// complete all-tables transaction until initial copy has fully
    /// finished.

    /// [`ReplicatedTableSchema`], so destinations can react to the correct
    /// schema version for that specific change.
