//! Apply loop implementation for processing PostgreSQL logical replication
//! events.
//!
//! This module provides the core apply loop that processes replication events
//! from PostgreSQL and coordinates table synchronization. It uses a
//! [`WorkerContext`] enum to enable different behavior based on the worker type
//! (apply worker vs table sync worker) at various points in the replication
//! cycle.
